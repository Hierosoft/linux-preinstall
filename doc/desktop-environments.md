# Desktop Environments

The desktop environment (DE) includes the Application menu (usually
something like the Start Menu on Windows), task bar or application
switcher, and basically anything you can see before you open any
programs. A simplified name for a DE I often use for novices is a "menu
system". Usually the DE also has its own preferred applications of
various sorts. The preferred applications are usually displayed with a
generic name such as "File Manager" "Text Editor", "Image Viewer" etc.
for ease of use but the specific project names may be hidden, such as
"Caja", "Pluma", and "Eye of MATE" respectively. Proprietary operating
systems like Windows or macOS may make surprise changes and they are
more difficult to customize (especially with regard to default
programs). You may not want to customize it, but if the corporation
such as Microsoft or Apple changes it in a way you don't like, you have
an uphill battle. On GNU+Linux systems, you can choose which desktop
environment is best for you, and mix and match free software as the
preferred applications.
