## Devuan Caveats
(tested on updated Devuan Chimera 2021-11-22)
- Devuan MATE will not start unless installed via tasksel rather than the mate-desktop package. If you install the mate-desktop package only, MATE will not appear as checked in tasksel, and choosing it then logging in will result in a blank background with a movable cursor.
