# Xfce

Xfce is a [lightweight desktop
environment](lightweight-desktop-environments.md) (DE) that comes with
several distro flavors/spins such as Xubuntu.

I find it lacking from the outset without the Whisker menu, but
Manjaro and perhaps Xubuntu and other distros install that by default.

I don't recommend Xfce for the following reason:

When I get into low-memory situations with Xfce it normally has a hard
freeze where I can't click anything. I know [nohang](nohang.md) (See
that link for info on other DEs that froze as well)
basically solved my low-memory freezes with Xfce. This
problem has gone on from approximately 2016-2022 until I gave up on Xfce
and started switching my customers to [MATE with some tweaks](MATE).
