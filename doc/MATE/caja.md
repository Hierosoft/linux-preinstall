# Caja

Caja is the File Manager for the MATE desktop. It can be enhanced with the following packages:
- caja-open-terminal (such as via [linux-preinstall/everyone/caja/caja-open-terminal.deb.sh](../../everyone/caja/caja-open-terminal.deb.sh) on Debian, Ubuntu, or their derivatives): Add "Open in Terminal" to the right-click menu (if no file is highlighted) to open a Terminal and automatically change to the directory.
