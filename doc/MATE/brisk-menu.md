# Brisk Menu
Brisk menu is available with the default MATE install, and has a nice searchable menu where you can add favorites, similar to Xfce's optional whisker menu (whisker menu is installed by default on Manjaro and perhaps Xubuntu and others).

## Installation
- Delete the Application Menu and add the Brisk Menu and move it to the left of the panel.

## Settings
See [gsettings.md](../gsettings.md)
