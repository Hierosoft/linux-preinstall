## VLC
This document is for users I've set up with large playlists.

### Find a song (browse collection)
Find a song using File Explorer:
* Double-click wav (or other folder on your computer that contains music)
* View, View as Detailed List

#### Change status
Renaming a file can remove a song from all playlists other than generated ones.
* Right-click, rename, change number
* Close "play music by rating window" (or other playlist) if open (next time you start it, song will come back with new priority).
