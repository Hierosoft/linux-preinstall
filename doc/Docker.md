## Storage
The overlay filesystem uses no storage in and of itself.

> An overlay filesystem, like a bind mount, doesn't use any disk space itself. What's reported is the disk space of the underlying filesystem. In this case, if you run `df /var/lib/docker` you'll see the same disk space allocated to that underlying filesystem, and you can review what is used on that mount.

$ docker system prune --help

Usage:  docker system prune [OPTIONS]

Remove unused data

Options:
  -a, --all             Remove all unused images not just dangling ones
      --filter filter   Provide filter values (e.g. 'label=<key>=<value>')
  -f, --force           Do not prompt for confirmation
      --volumes         Prune volumes
```

> The overlay2 folder should contain the filesystem layers needed for your images and containers. You're free to ignore this advice, but please don't ask me for advice on how to recover a failed system after you break it, particularly since I gave you a supported way to cleanup your filesystem.
