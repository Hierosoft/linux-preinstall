# Native Linux Games That Go Beyond Casual Gaming
This list focuses primarily on games in linux repositories, which mostly includes free games and game stores but also includes a games that require a paid account.

This list does not include games described above if they are:
* games that require a disc or downloaded commercial data (such as ScummVM or trine)
* games that are run-of-the-mill shooters just with different levels and graphics
* games with primitive gameplay or graphics
* puzzle games

My initial reason for looking up linux games this time was that not all games were listed under the "Games" category on Antergos, which neither includes ufoai nor any AUR games (actually, some of the gaming platforms and stores aren't even listed under the games keyword in the AUR website). I had to search for "game" in Add/Remove Software in Antergos but I'm still not sure if I saw all that is available. As for AUR, I found out that on the AUR website you can sort programs by popularity and started there. For games that weren't listed there due to lack of a "games" keyword in AUR I had to work from memory.

Please feel free to comment and mention games I missed if they meet all of the criteria in the first section. However, I excluded some popular native linux games intentionally because I believe they don’t.
