# Linux Preinstall Documentation

An overview of the scripts is in the main [readme.md][../readme.md],
whereas the Linux Preinstall Documentation covers some more details
such as information specific to your distro, software, or a certain
script. Read on (see other files in this directory) to find out how
different scripts work together for a certain distro, or read about why
the scripts are included in some cases.
