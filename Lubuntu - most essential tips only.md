## Lubuntu tips
(most essential tips)
* To shut down or reboot, first click power button button (bottom right), then after the menu appears (may take a couple minutes to open if an application is hanging) then click shut down or reboot.
* Office: Abiword can be used for documents and Gnumeric for spreadsheets. However, Abiword cannot open and save many Word doc files from Microsoft Office correctly, only Abiword's limited feature set Word docs. LibreOffice takes around 229 MB of RAM so it is not feasible for systems with 256MB or less. To edit docs for professional use, Google Drive or another cloud office should work even with low RAM. Otherwise save in RTF format which has fewer features by default and can be read on virtually all computers.
* If you need microsoft fonts, see help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Microsoft_Fonts 
* For Task Manager click menu button (bottom left), System Tools, Task Manager
* In Digital Clock settings, %R is for 24-hr view and %I:%M %p is for 12 hr (with am/pm)
* To force an update, use menu, Run, then enter: update-manager -d
* If the wifi manager is missing (up-down arrow task tray icon) it can be run with menu, Run, nm-applet

Lubuntu text mode terminal tips:
* For typing commands, click menu, Accessories, LXTerminal
* If commands say they have no permission, type sudo then a space then the command.
* If stuck in a text-only terminal, try Ctrl Alt F7 to get back to GUI terminal. If still stuck:
``
sudo reboot
```
enter.
