Configure redshift (location for yourself can be found via Google Maps)
where 5600 is day temp and 3400 is night temp:

`redshift -l 40.3832256:-75.2748652 -t 5600:3400`

Has to remain running, so use GUI instead (drag widget to KDE panel, then right-click to configure:
 * turn on smooth transitions
 * set temps to 5600 and 3400
 * click Locate [if fails, use coords for your location such as above]
 * Apply
