#These instructions were done using a mid-2006 Intel Mac Mini (Mac Mini often have ATI cards)
#before using these instructions, be sure to replace 1280 1024 with a resolution compatible with your monitor--the optimal resolution can often can be found by going to the monitor's built-in menu.
cvt 1280 1024 60
#in the next line, change x to the output that appeared when you typed the previous line
xrandr --newmode x
xrandr --addmode VGA-0 1280x1024_60.00
#The last line, below, only works if you (page in link below says to use DVI-0 and VGA-0, but the proper names can be found by typing xrandr without any params)
xrandr --output DVI1 --off --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024_60.00

#The screen should go black, and resolution should change immediately.
