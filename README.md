# linux-preinstall
Put first-time setup in easy mode for GNU+Linux systems! Make the system ready to use from day one.

These scripts automatically install programs and configure settings many users expect, and inform you of any manual steps needed. I regularly update and use these scripts for myself and people I help. These scripts have been in development since 2016, but due to growth and specialization I've added them to git to make installation even easier (web install from git).

## GOALS
* Make the GNU+Linux system ready to use from day one.
* Separate scripts by distro (Ubuntu, Fedora).
* Separate scripts by workflow (end user, developer, server).
