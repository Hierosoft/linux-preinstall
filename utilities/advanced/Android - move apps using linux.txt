# Move Android Phone's Apps Using gdb on Linux

Before you do all of this, see if you can move the app using: "Apps 2 SD (move app 2 sd) by Gregory House" on Google Play.
* also see if you can move it using that app with Developer Options turned on (see below, then click Developer Options to turn on)

* On Phone
	* tap build number 7 times
	* go back twice
	* in developer options (newly enabled settings section), enable USB Debug Mode
* On Computer
	* install adb (comes with android platform tools or similarly named package)
```
cd /opt/android-sdk/platform-tools
./adb shell
#should try to connect to device now, but you must accept the using your phone:
```
* On Phone: accept the connection and store certificate permanently
* On Computer:
```
#if you still have a linux prompt (as opposed to an Android prompt such as `shell@w3c:/ $`), run:
adb shell
#this shows what location for apps to be installed:
pm get-install-location
#you can optionally set the install location for new apps to the memory card (this is most reliable method):
#should already be 0 (automatic), but you can set to 1 (internal memory), or 2 (memory card)
pm set-install-location 2
#or for versions earlier than 4.x (pre API 14):
#pm setInstallLocation 2

pm list packages -i | grep angry
#take note of package name such as com.rovio.angrybirds
# and installer name (found via -i option) such as com.android.vending

pm list packages -i | grep fruit
#take note of package name such as com.halfbrick.fruitninjafree
# and installer name (found via -i option) such as com.android.vending

#get full path of app (see also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11012976/get-apk-of-installed-app ):

pm path com.rovio.angrybirds
#take note of the full apk path such as /mnt/asec/com.rovio.angrybirds-2/pkg.apk

pm path com.halfbrick.fruitninjafree
#take note of the full apk path such as /mnt/asec/com.halfbrick.fruitninjafree-1/pkg.apk

#then do the following except change the names to your app:
pm install -i com.android.vending -f -r /mnt/asec/com.rovio.angrybirds-2/pkg.apk
pm install -i com.android.vending -f -r /mnt/asec/com.halfbrick.fruitninjafree-1/pkg.apk
```
