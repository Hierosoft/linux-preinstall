#ISSUE: trying to update produces keyring errors, but upgrading keyring also produces same error:
#error: antergos-keyring: signature from "Antergos Build Server (Automated Package Build System) <admin@antergos.org>" is marginal trust
#:: File /var/cache/pacman/pkg/antergos-keyring-20170524-1-any.pkg.tar.xz is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).
#Do you want to delete it? [Y/n] n
#error: failed to commit transaction (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature))
#Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded.

#Joe at https://jonathanmh.com/antergos-keyring-unknown-trust-solved/
#says this far down in forum worked -- https://forum.antergos.com/topic/2604/problem-with-pacman-mirrorlist-being-corrupted/37?page=2
sudo pacman -S haveged
sudo haveged -w 1024
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux antergos
sudo pkill haveged

#Joe says "then updating the keyring package worked:"
#sudo pacman -Sy antergos-keyring
#that didn't work so skipped: sudo pacman -Syyu

#and tried https://jonathanmh.com/antergos-keyring-unknown-trust-solved/ :
sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys
#still didn't let me do: sudo pacman -Sy antergos-keyring

#so did following instructions from 
echo "change Trusts section to:"
echo "# By default, pacman accepts packages signed by keys que its location keyring"
echo "# Trusts (see pacman-key and its man page), as well as unsigned packages."
echo "SigLevel = Optional TrustAll"
echo "LocalFileSigLevel = Optional"
echo "#RemoteFileSigLevel = Required"
sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf
echo "After changing the SigLevel line to the one above, this should work:"
sudo pacman -Sy antergos-keyring
sudo pacman -Syyu
#still had errors with other packages (gitkracken, pamac) so did:
sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys

#same error on update,
#so install "testing package of keyring" as per https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=229378
sudo pacman -U https://www.archlinux.org/packages/testing/any/archlinux-keyring/download/
#same error on update,
#so sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys
#sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux antergos

#still nothing worked, so changed /etc/pacman.conf back to: SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
#then did full system upgrade

#but then found this:
#thomas.kerpe's answer on https://forum.antergos.com/topic/6984/error-with-antergos-keyring/46
gpg --recv-key 24B445614FAC071891EDCE49CDBD406AA1AA7A1D
gpg -a --export 24B445614FAC071891EDCE49CDBD406AA1AA7A1D | sudo pacman-key -a -
yaourt -S antergos-keyring

#however supposedly the following alternative method also works:
sudo pacman -Syuw
sudo pacman -U antergos-keyring
sudo pacman -U antergos-mirrorlist

#updated, but had mime errors, so:
sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime

#Then I realized I had SigLevel still turned off in pacman.conf.
#error came back on Antergos.
#No solutions above worked.
#Tried some solutions from https://forum.antergos.com/topic/6962/numix-icon-theme-signature-is-unknown-trust/11
sudo pacman -S reflector
#just's oneliner:
sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys && sudo reflector --age 8 --fastest 128 --latest 64 --number 32 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist && yaourt -Syyua && sync
#didn't work (same error, signing pamac,spl-utils,spl,zfs-utils
#then:
sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys
#then dangerous solution:
sudo pacman -Scc
#then reply with explicit y to the first question
sudo pacman -Syy
sudo haveged -w 1024
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux antergos
sudo pkill haveged
sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring antergos-keyring
sudo pacman -Syu
#did not help.
#tried customizing ignore for my errors:
sudo pacman -Syu --ignore pamac,spl-utils,spl,zfs-utils
sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys
#still has problems, so disable checking again in /etc/pacman.conf then:
sudo pacman -Syu

## Manjaro solution

Without turning if off on a Manjaro machine with the same problem, the problem was resolved with the following Antergos wiki solution (where alternative method above doesn't work):
(didn't try to the gpg  --recv-key method above, but the following worked anyway)
#from http://antergos.com/wiki/uncategorized/update-error-involving-keyrings/
sudo pacman -Scc
sudo pacman-key --refresh-keys
sudo pacman -Syu
